# Cellular Automata Rule30

### What if I told you that **"randomness"** in computer systems are real gimmick!

_Computer Systems are not skilled enough to produce real random numbers, they use deterministic algorithms to produce numbers which look random but follows an order which is derived from a seed value._

> I've seen that most of the time `new Date()` (which is the current datetime) is given as the seed.

These pseudorandom numbers are prone to repeat the same pattern if provided with the same seed value.

## Rule30

Rule30 is a similar deterministic pseudorandom number generator algorithm used for a long time by **Stephen Wolfram**.
